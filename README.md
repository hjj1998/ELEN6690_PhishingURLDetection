# ELEN6690_PhishingURLDetection
Phishing and malicious URL detection using different ML methods.
Our team addressed phishing URL problem from a statistical view, extracting the common difference of features between the phishing mail and normal ones, and
generalizing the features in a model by a range of different algorithms. In the experiment, we applied and compared eight different machine learning methods: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, SVM, Random Forest, Adaboost, Gradient Boosting and XGBoost. We trained and tested these models with the Website Phishing Data Set (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Website+Phishing) which is collected from Phishtank Data Archive (www.phishtank.com).
